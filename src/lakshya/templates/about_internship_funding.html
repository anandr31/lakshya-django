	<h2>About Internship Funding</h2>
	<div class="content_div">
		<div class="q_and_a">

			<p class="question">Why should I sponsor a student's internship program?</p>
			<p class="answer">Internships are a proven way to gain relevant knowledge, skills, and experience while building an important network of experts in the field. It makes the classroom’s theories and teaching more relevant and incrases retention through practical research and real-world applications. Not every university offering an internship will provide a stipend which is immensely necessary for students to sustain themselves during the internhip period.</p>

			<p class="question">How will it impact the NITW ecosystem?</p>
			<p class="answer">
<ul>
<li><b>Confidence</b>: The financial back up will enable students to apply for prestigious universities in India and abroad. Getting an internship in top colleges is a challenging task for which requires research bent and aptitude.</li>

<li><b>Awareness</b>: The students who benefit through this program conduct sessions for junior batches and guide them on various aspects of building a profile, applying for an internship, and on what to expect. We began with 5 applications in 2013 and 15 in 2014. This clearly indicates the growing interest and capability of our students.</li>
</ul>
</p>
			<p class="question">How are funds transferred to the student?</p>
			<p class="answer">A cheque is made out and given to each beneficiary. Once the donation is made, you will receive a conformation mail and a receipt which can be used to claim tax exemption.</p>
